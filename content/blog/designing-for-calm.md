When we strip away the noise from our products, what remains is clarity. This is something I've been thinking about a lot lately, both in my work as a product manager and in how I approach life with a newborn at home.

## The Allure of More

It's tempting to add features. Every stakeholder has a request, every competitor has something we don't, and every brainstorm session generates a dozen "what if we also..." ideas. The path of least resistance often feels like saying yes.

But here's what I've learned: the products that stick with us—the ones we actually enjoy using—are often the ones that do less, better.

## Lessons from the Kitchen

Cooking has taught me this lesson repeatedly. The best dishes I've made aren't the ones with the most ingredients or the most complex techniques. They're the ones where each element has a purpose, where nothing fights for attention.

A perfectly seared piece of salmon with just lemon and fresh herbs. A simple pasta with good olive oil, garlic, and parmesan. These dishes succeed because of restraint, not despite it.

## Applying Calm to Product Work

In product management, this translates to a few principles I try to follow:

1. **Every feature should earn its place.** If I can't articulate why something needs to exist in two sentences, it probably doesn't.

2. **Whitespace is a feature.** The empty space in an interface isn't wasted—it's working to help users focus on what matters.

3. **Saying no is a skill.** It's harder than saying yes, but it's often more valuable.

## The Personal Side

Becoming a parent has only reinforced these beliefs. With less time and energy, you become ruthless about what actually matters. The noise falls away, and you're left with what's essential.

I've found myself applying this same filter to everything—work projects, personal goals, even how I spend my weekends. Less scrolling, more reading. Less planning, more doing. Less stuff, more experiences.

## Looking Forward

I'm still learning how to design for calm, both in products and in life. But I'm convinced it's the right direction. In a world that constantly demands our attention, the greatest gift we can give users—and ourselves—is simplicity.

What does designing for calm look like in your work? I'd love to hear your thoughts.
